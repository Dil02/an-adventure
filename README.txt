WELCOME TO AN ADVENTURE! - 16th April 2021

'An Adventure' is a text based adventure game I developed in Java using Object Oriented principles. 
The user travels around the world seeking the pieces of a mystical torch with the aiming of 
revealing the location of a great treasure!

This project involved:

* Collections (ArrayLists)
* Exception Handling
* File I/O
* A Graphical User Interface
* Inheritance
* Music
* Polymorphism

To get it working:

Simply download this repository which contains all the necessary files to get you up and running.
I recommend running the game in Blue J as I have provided the package file. 
Lastly, compile and run the main method in the Game class.
